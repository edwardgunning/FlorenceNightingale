# Florence Nightingale
#### by Edward Gunning

Celebration of Florence Nightingale's Bicentenary by recreating some of her work with `ggplot2` and other R packages.

I have uploaded a scanned (color) pdf containing some of the original diagrams and data called  `MortalityofTheBritishArmy.pdf`. It's available at [this archive](https://archive.org/details/mortalityofbriti00lond/page/n41/mode/2up).


## 1 Nightingale's Coxcombs/ Rose Diagram
Perhaps Nightingale's most famous known as the _Coxcomb_, the _Polar Area Chart_ or the _Rose Diagram_. See [Understanding Uncertainty](https://understandinguncertainty.org/node/214) for a good description. Code is in `Rose Diagram.R`.
