# Florence Nightingale
#### by Edward Gunning

Celebration of Florence Nightingale's Bicentenary by recreating some of her work with `ggplot2` and other R packages.

I have uploaded a scanned (color) pdf containing some of the original diagrams and data called  `MortalityofTheBritishArmy.pdf`. It's available at [this archive](https://archive.org/details/mortalityofbriti00lond/page/n41/mode/2up).


## 1 Nightingale's Coxcomb/ Rose Diagram
Perhaps Nightingale's most famous known as the _Coxcomb_, the _Polar Area Chart_ or the _Rose Diagram_. See [Understanding Uncertainty](https://understandinguncertainty.org/node/214) for a good description. All code is [here](Rose Diagram Code.R).

Ive transcribed the data from pg. 12 (22nd page of the [pdf](https://archive.org/details/mortalityofbriti00lond/page/n41/mode/2up)) and uploaded it [here](EnglishMortalitydata.xlsx), to recreate the diagram on the 35th page of the [pdf](https://archive.org/details/mortalityofbriti00lond/page/n41/mode/2up). The code to create the line chart is in [this script](Lines Diagram B.R).
